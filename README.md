# Lab-2-Comparison-of-Performance-of-Sorting-Algorithms
Algorithm design and analysis, Lab 2 â€“ Comparison of Performance of Sorting Algorithms

Implement Insertion, Quick and Bucket Sort and compare their performance by execution time and memory usage.
The numbers that should be used for sorting are in range of 1 to 10 000.
Test each algorithm for randomly generated arrays of 100, 1000, 10k, 100k, 1M, 10M and 100M elements.
